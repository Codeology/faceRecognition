# openCaVo ðŸ“¸ - Codeology Sp23

## ðŸ¥‘ Overview
With openCaVo, we will simplify the (sometimes) annoying task of taking attendance with a slight invasion of privacy. We will be building openCaVo, a React Native app that takes pictures of people, identifies them, and consolidates a list of the names of people in the picture. First, we will supply and store pictures using Firebase. Then, to recognize faces, we will process the images using OpenCV along with some ML concepts. Finally, we will wrap everything into an API to be called by our React Native app! Join this project for a fun introduction to full stack development, computer vision, and machine learning!
